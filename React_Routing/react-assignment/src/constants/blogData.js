    blogText: `Some roads are just different then others, Roads that remind you to be calm, to hold trust in yourself and to believe, believe that everything happens for some good reason,Roads that see you loosing your mind and your hope, roads that see you shaking from within and then again helping you to collect your scattered pieces of hope.. Some roads you walk alone, and as you get out of those roads, you just feel good about everything, you feel more confident.Some roads that make you realise that the things that breaks you make you even more stronger!!`,
